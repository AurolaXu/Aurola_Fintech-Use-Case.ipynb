Project Scope
In the project, I use LendingClub dataset to predict if an unknown loan will default or not. It is also a loan rate prediction.

Dataset: https://www.lendingclub.com/info/statistics.action

# About LendingClub

1. LendingClub(LC) is one of the biggest Public American peer-to-peer lending company. It was also the first peer-to-peer lender
2. LendingClub(LC) directly connects investors and Borrowers. Hence, by skipping banks, investors can have higher profits and borrowers can have lower interest rate.
3. LendingClub(LC) currently worth 1.6 Billion.
- For investor, whether a loan will default is the key. If the loan defaults, the investor might loss Investment principal. Even though, LC has Guaranteed Terms for protection, it won't secure the Investment principal.
- Under the premise of loan security, another question is how to determine loan rates. A good rate should meet people's expectation, which is based on borrowers' risk and unquie condition. Hence, a good strategy is to personalize each loan product.
- The historical data shows current charge off rate is around 8 - 10%. Obviously, there are different level of loans with various risk levels.

# The Problem

The current problem is, although LendingClub provides basic information about a loan product, it's still difficult for investors to make an accurate prediction. Their decision always based on their own confidence. Since investors can't have direct conversations with borrowers. All the information comes from files and data.

# Goal: 
Build a machine learning model as a simple tool to help investors make investment decisions:
1.  Whether a loan will be charge off
2.  The reasonable interest rate
